| Monetary terms           | By default, a channel controls 70% of its advertising inventory, and keeps 100% of the gross revenue earned on these ads. The remaining30% of the channel's inventory routes to Roku, in which case Roku retains 100% of gross revenue earned on the ads it delivers.     | Roku manages 100% of the channel's advertising inventory and will either share 60% of net revenue earned on paid ads served in the channel with the publisher (net of a 15% operational and serving fee) or will pay the publisher a fixed CPM for ads served in the channel, at Roku's discretion. Publishers should be aware that Roku-branded advertisements ("house ads") are not considered a paid ad. If participating in a Revenue Share arrangement, Roku will attempt to fill ad inventory trafficked through the channel and maximize the publisher's monetary returns, but makes no guarantee of a minimum delivery.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Eligibility requirements | All ad-supported channels will default to the Inventory Split option, regardless of audience size or hours streamed. However, Roku may not begin filling the 30% of ad inventory it manages until it has concluded its content appropriateness review of the channel.     | Channels can apply to be included in the Revenue Share model by emailing Roku's Publisher Ad Services team at publisheradservices@roku.com. In the subject line of the email, type “New Application Request for Admittance to Roku Ad Revenue Share,” and include the channel name and channel ID in the body of the email. Roku will prioritize applications from channels with the largest install bases and usage volumes, and reserves the right to reject channel partners at its sole discretion. Admission into the Revenue Share model is not guaranteed under any circumstances. Channel publishers can work with our Audience Development team to grow an audience of relevant, engaged viewers, in order to maximize the likelihood of admission in the Revenue Share model. To learn more about these capabilities, visit the Roku Advertising site. Publishers can also purchase promotional display ads for their channels on the Roku home screen by using Roku's self-serve ad buying tool. |
| Backend requirements     | Channel sets up its own ad server and manages its own advertising demand. 30% of all advertising inventory is routed to Roku to be filled.                                                                                                                                | Channel uses a revenue-share tag provided by Roku on ads delivered on the platform. Roku will have first right to fill advertising inventory. The channel publisher can also configure their own advertising server as a fallback for instances when Roku does not fill inventory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Payout period            | Channels retain 100% of the revenue on advertisements they manage. Publishers should not expect payments from Roku.                                                                                                                                                       | Channels are paid quarterly, no later than 60 days after the end of each quarter. Publishers will not be paid until 1) the aggregate sums due are equal to or exceed $500; or 2) the publisher's distribution agreement with Roku expires or is terminated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
